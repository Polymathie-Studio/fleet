# FLEET

FLEET is delivery: the markup, head tags, and config that make a shipped page load fast and stable. A page can look finished and still be slow and janky, an oversized hero image that arrives late, content that jumps as images and fonts load, a render blocked behind scripts. That damage is invisible until measured, which is exactly when a fast build skips it. FLEET emits the correct markup and configuration, and audits a page for the misses, against the Core Web Vitals (Largest Contentful Paint, Cumulative Layout Shift, Interaction to Next Paint).

It covers its primitizable delivery set across Tiers 1 to 3: Tier 1, the responsive-image and picture emitter with reserved dimensions and correct scheduling; Tier 2, resource-hint and font head tags plus a cache-header config generator; and Tier 3, a delivery auditor and a Speculation Rules generator. It stays **0.x** until a numbered release is cut.

## What FLEET is, and is not

FLEET is honest about a boundary the other Polymathie primitives do not have. A zero-dependency, native-first primitive can emit correct delivery markup, correct head tags, and correct config text, and it can audit HTML. It cannot compress an image, bundle JavaScript, or set a cache header, because those are build-tool and server work. So FLEET emits the `<img>` and `<picture>` markup that points at your optimized files, generates the cache config your host applies, and audits the result; it does not encode the pixels or ship the bytes. Producing the optimized images and bundles stays with your build; FLEET makes sure the markup and config around them are correct.

## Quickstart

### Any site, no framework

```js
import { img, picture, srcset } from 'fleet-ui'

// The hero (LCP) image: reserved dimensions, eager, high priority, never lazy.
img({
  src: '/hero-1200.jpg',
  alt: 'The product on a desk',
  width: 1200,
  height: 800,
  srcset: srcset('/hero.jpg', [600, 900, 1200]),
  sizes: '(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 1200px',
  priority: true,
})

// An offscreen image: lazy, async decode, dimensions reserved.
img({ src: '/photo.jpg', alt: 'A photo', width: 800, height: 600, lazy: true })

// Format negotiation with a fallback:
picture({
  src: '/photo.jpg', alt: 'A photo', width: 800, height: 600,
  avif: '/photo.avif', webp: '/photo.webp', lazy: true,
})
```

### React

```tsx
import { Img, Picture, srcset } from 'fleet-ui/react'

<Img src="/hero-1200.jpg" alt="The product on a desk" width={1200} height={800}
     srcset={srcset('/hero.jpg', [600, 900, 1200])} sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 1200px"
     priority />

<Picture src="/photo.jpg" alt="A photo" width={800} height={600} avif="/photo.avif" webp="/photo.webp" lazy />
```

## The LCP image rule

The single most common delivery anti-pattern is lazy-loading the Largest Contentful Paint image, the hero, which delays the very element that defines the metric. FLEET makes the choice explicit: mark the LCP image `priority: true` (eager, `fetchpriority="high"`) and mark offscreen images `lazy: true`. An image that is neither is left at the browser default (eager), which is safe for the LCP image. Always set `width` and `height` so the box is reserved and nothing shifts as the image loads.

## Head tags and cache config

Resource hints, font preloads, and font-face blocks are head and CSS strings; the cache-header generator renders the correct pattern into a named host's config format.

```js
import { hints, preconnect, fontPreload, fontFace, cacheHeaders } from 'fleet-ui'

// Resource hints: preconnect for critical origins, preload for late-discovered assets.
hints([
  { rel: 'preconnect', href: 'https://cdn.example.com', crossorigin: true },
  { rel: 'preload', href: '/app.js', as: 'script' },
])
fontPreload('/fonts/inter.woff2')

// A zero-shift fallback face (the size-adjust value is measured, so you pass it):
fontFace({ family: "'Inter Fallback'", src: 'local("Arial")', display: 'swap', sizeAdjust: '107%' })

// Cache headers: revalidate HTML, cache hashed assets for a year as immutable.
cacheHeaders('netlify')   // or 'vercel', 'nginx'
```

In React, `Hints` renders the link tags (and `fontFace` and `cacheHeaders` are re-exported as the string generators):

```tsx
import { Hints } from 'fleet-ui/react'

<Hints hints={[{ rel: 'preconnect', href: 'https://cdn.example.com', crossorigin: true }]} />
```

The cache config is a build-time file and the font-face is CSS, so neither has a React component; call the generator and write its output.

## Auditing a page

`audit(html)` scans a page's HTML and returns `{ ok, errors, warnings, passed }`, flagging the delivery misses: images without width or height (which cause layout shift), a first image that is lazy-loaded (a likely LCP image delayed), render-blocking scripts in the head, and inline `@font-face` without `font-display`. Delivery issues are advisory, so most land as warnings.

```js
import { audit, speculationRules } from 'fleet-ui'

const report = audit(serverHtmlString)
report.warnings.forEach((w) => console.warn(w.code, w.message))

// Speculation Rules (emerging, Chromium-only; degrades to nothing elsewhere):
speculationRules({ prerender: { where: { href_matches: '/*' }, eagerness: 'moderate' } })
```

Like the other primitives' auditors, this is a lightweight scan of the served markup, not a full performance run; pair it with Lighthouse for field-accurate Core Web Vitals.

## Part of the Polymathie family

FLEET is one of the [Polymathie](https://github.com/Polymathie-Studio) primitives: small, dependency-free pieces for building websites, dashboards, and tools, where each protects one posture that fast, AI-assisted building tends to drop. Its siblings are [TEMPER](https://github.com/Polymathie-Studio/temper) (legibility and design tokens), [LUCID](https://github.com/Polymathie-Studio/lucid) (honest disclosure), [HASP](https://github.com/Polymathie-Studio/hasp) (bring-your-own-key privacy), [GRACE](https://github.com/Polymathie-Studio/grace) (off-happy-path states), [GRASP](https://github.com/Polymathie-Studio/grasp) (operable interaction components), and [BEACON](https://github.com/Polymathie-Studio/beacon) (findability). Like BEACON, FLEET is a build and SSR-time generator, and it is honest that delivery has levers a drop-in primitive cannot pull.
